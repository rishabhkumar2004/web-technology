Flexbox is a way to arrange items into rows or columns.
 These items will flex (i.e. grow or shrink)
  based on some rules that you can define.
 To get started, let’s look at a demonstration.

As you’ve seen, flexbox is not just a single CSS property
 but a whole toolbox of properties 
that you can use to put things where you need them.
 Some of these properties belong on the flex container, while some go on the flex items. This is an important concept.

A flex container is any element that has display: flex on it.
 A flex item is any element that lives directly inside of a flex container.
